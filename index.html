        <p>Redeeming Truth Music is a collaborative team of songwriters and artists who serve in the music ministry of Redeemer Bible Church. We began in the Summer of 2022 with the desire to write and arrange biblically sound music to be sung in corporate worship. Our aim is for the Word of Christ to dwell in us richly, and we believe that a key way for that to happen is to write and sing songs that are saturated in Scripture.</p>
